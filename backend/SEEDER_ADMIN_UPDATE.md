## 🚀 Usage

The seeder works exactly the same way:

### Automatic (Server Start)
```bash
npm start
```

### Manual
```bash
npm run seed
```

## 📝 Updated Documentation

All documentation files have been updated to reflect:
- Admin user inclusion
- Updated user counts
- New credential information
- Proper role separation

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Admin password is different from regular users (`admin123` vs `password123`)
- All passwords are properly hashed with bcrypt
- Admin user is excluded from customer-specific operations (pet ownership, reviews, etc.)
- Proper role-based data assignment
- **Admin Identification:** Admin privileges are determined by email (`admin@petdash.com`), not userType
- Admin user has Business userType but is identified as admin by the `isAdmin()` function in controllers

## ✅ Verification

After seeding, you can verify:

1. **Total Users:** 6 users created
2. **Admin Access:** Login with admin credentials
3. **Categories:** Exactly 5 categories available
4. **Data Integrity:** All relationships properly maintained

The seeder now provides a complete admin user for system management while maintaining exactly 5 service categories as requested! 🎉
