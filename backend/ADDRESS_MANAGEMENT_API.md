# Address Management API Documentation

## Overview
The Address Management API allows users to manage multiple addresses with one designated as primary. This system maintains backward compatibility with existing legacy address fields while providing enhanced functionality.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Multiple Addresses**: Users can add, update, and delete multiple addresses
- **Primary Address**: One address can be designated as primary
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy address fields are automatically synced
- **Soft Delete**: Addresses are soft-deleted to maintain data integrity
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all address fields

## üìã API Endpoints

### Base URL: `/api/profile`

All endpoints require authentication via Bearer token.

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

The system maintains full backward compatibility:

1. **Legacy Fields**: `streetName`, `city`, `state`, `zipCode` are still available
2. **Auto-Sync**: Primary address changes automatically update legacy fields
3. **Migration**: Existing users' legacy data is preserved and migrated to the new system

## üõ°Ô∏è Business Rules

1. **Unique Labels**: Each user can only have one address per label
2. **Primary Address**: Only one address can be primary at a time
3. **Minimum Addresses**: Users must have at least one active address
4. **Auto-Primary**: If no addresses exist, the first added address becomes primary
5. **Legacy Sync**: Primary address always syncs with legacy fields

## üîß Migration

Run the migration script to convert existing legacy address data:

```bash
node backend/migrations/migrateAddresses.js
```

This script will:
- Find users with legacy address data
- Create primary addresses from legacy fields
- Preserve all existing data
- Skip users with incomplete address information

The address management system is now ready for use with full backward compatibility! üéâ
