# Appointment System Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a complete appointment management system for your Pet Patch USA application. The system allows pet owners to book appointments with service providers and automatically sends professional email confirmations to both parties.

## ðŸš€ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Model (`models/Appointment.js`)
- **Appointment Schema** with all necessary fields:
  - Customer and business references
  - Service and pet references
  - Date and time scheduling
  - Pricing details (subtotal, tax, total)
  - Add-on services support
  - Status tracking (upcoming, completed, cancelled)
  - Unique booking ID generation
  - Email notification tracking

### 2. API Controller (`controllers/appointmentController.js`)
- **Create Appointment**: Books new appointments with validation
- **Get Customer Appointments**: Retrieves appointments for pet owners
- **Get Business Appointments**: Retrieves appointments for service providers
- **Get Appointment Details**: Fetches detailed appointment information
- **Update Appointment Status**: Allows status changes
- **Email Integration**: Automatic email notifications using Nodemailer

### 3. API Routes (`routes/appointmentRoutes.js`)
- `POST /api/appointment/create` - Create new appointment
- `GET /api/appointment/customer` - Get customer appointments
- `GET /api/appointment/business` - Get business appointments
- `GET /api/appointment/:appointmentId` - Get appointment details
- `PUT /api/appointment/:appointmentId/status` - Update appointment status

### 4. Email System (`utils/emailTemplates.js`)
- **Professional HTML Email Templates**:
  - Customer confirmation email with booking details
  - Business notification email with customer and pet info
  - Responsive design with modern styling
  - Branded with Pet Patch USA theme

### 5. Testing Tools
- **Postman Collection** (`Appointment-API-Collection.postman_collection.json`)
- **Test Script** (`test-appointment.js`)
- **Updated API Documentation** in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`

  },
  body: JSON.stringify({

    petId: selectedPet._id,
    appointmentDate: '2024-05-20',
    appointmentTime: '11:00 AM',
    subtotal: 80,
    tax: 20,
    total: 100,
    notes: 'Pet is nervous around strangers'
  })
});
```

### For Business Owner App:

## ðŸ”„ Workflow
